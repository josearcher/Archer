            <p>Greetings! I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Informatics and Computing Engineering 
                (LEIC) at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto (FEUP). Despite not having a clear vision on the field, I plan to follow my academic path by enrolling in a Master's program.
